# Random Hacks and Scripts

Not saying this is good code...but just a few items put together to achieve small tasks or ideas when I get bored.

- `encode_ip.py`: A script to encode an IPv4 address various ways.

- `proxy.py`: Easy HTTP proxy (default proxy is localhost:8080).

- `type_juggling.py`: A script to scan source code for type juggling vulns.

- `test_network.sh`: A script to test basic network connection.
