Not saying this is good code...but just a few items put together to achieve small tasks or ideas when I get bored.

- Bash
    - `test_network.sh`: A script to test basic network connection.

- Python
    - `arp_broadcast`: A script to broadcast an ARP packet for network discovery (Requires root)
    - `encode_ip.py`: A script to encode an IPv4 address various ways.
